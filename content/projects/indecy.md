Indecy - this is Java/Groovy based library for building business processes for your app.

With Indecy, you can write in Java few lines of code and create for each business process separate `.groovy` file or aggregate several in one. That's allow to separate app business logic from details of customer business logic and modularize the application.

Feel free to download last JAR from my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ansvir/indecy) and follow the manual!
